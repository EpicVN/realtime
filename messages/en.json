            "a1": "No. The Realtime system is built on a centralized cloud computing model, helping businesses optimize initial investment costs. You only need an Internet connection and flexible devices like IP Phones, Softphones on computers, or analog phones via IP Gateways.",
            "q2": "If my company expands personnel, is upgrading complicated?",
            "a2": "Completely simple. The system architecture is designed to be ready for expansion at any time. You just need to upgrade the service package according to user \"Blocks\" (like Block 10, Block 20...) to increase the number of extensions without changing the existing technical infrastructure.",
            "q3": "Can employees use the PBX if they work remotely or go on business trips?",
            "a3": "Yes. The system supports multiple platforms (Web, Mobile App, Softphone). Employees can log in and make/receive calls, and take care of customers anywhere as long as there is an Internet connection.",
            "q4": "Is it easy to listen to old calls to check service quality?",
            "a4": "Very easy. The system automatically records and stores call history. Managers can search, playback, or download recording files right on the management web browser.",
            "q5": "Does the system support automatic OTP reading or debt reminders by voice?",
            "a5": "Yes. With integrated Text-To-Speech and Auto Call solutions, the system can automatically make calls to read OTPs, announce balances, remind appointments, or remind debts completely automatically with natural AI voices.",
